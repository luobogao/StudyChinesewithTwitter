<h2>Study Chinese with Twitter</h2>
<div>
<p>Finding level-appropriate real-world sentences to practice reading Chinese can be difficult. Many language learning apps offer collections of sentences, but these are often not sentences actually encountered in "the wild".</p>
<p>Twitter is a gold mine of sentences that people actually say. While not the predominate language on Twitter, a steady stream of tweets provides an endless supply of learning material - if you know how to find it.</p>

<p>I've created a Twitter bot which browses all Chinese-language tweets, then re-tweets those that are at an appropriate level for beginning and intermediate learners. This bot posts at <a href="https://twitter.com/luobogao5">@luobogao5</a>, updated with around 100 new tweets per day. It turns out that when you remove all tweets that are very complex, or contain only media, and are a decent length for learning something interesting (10-20 characters), there are only about this many tweets which pass this high standard.</p>

<h2>Android App</h2>
<div>
<p>This Github project is an Android app which pulls from this Twitter account. Users can then filter by their HSK level (you must be at least HSK 3 - only this level and above has enough vocabulary to make interesting sentences!). Each tweet is guaranteed to be at that level, PLUS one additional vocabulary word (this can be disabled).</p>
<p>Personally, I find that my learning brain can handle no more than one brand-new word per sentence. However, it is also a good idea to keep pushing our language boundaries by constantly adding exposure to new words. Plus, by allowing for one complex word to appear in a tweet, many more interesting tweets qualify!</p>
<p>This app was made in Android Studio. Unzip this repository and open in the Studio to then deploy on your own device.</p>

  You will need to generate your own keys - place them in a file "apikey.properties" at the root level:
